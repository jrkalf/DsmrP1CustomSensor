# DsmrP1CustomSensor

I copied the code from @NLDROID from Github. 
This is his first custom component for EspHome. Which I copied and adjusted to my specific needs.
It can be used to read DSMR data from the P1 port of dutch smart meters. My specific needs are DSMR 2.2 as I have a very old (2013) Landis + Gyr E350 ZCF1120 meter.

The work is based on this project: https://github.com/fliphess/esp8266_p1meter
